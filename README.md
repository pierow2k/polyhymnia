## What is Polyhymnia?

Polyhymnia is a command-line tool that leverages the Datamuse API to enable users to search for words based on [meaning](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-meaning/), [sound](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-sound/), [spelling](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-spelling/), and [relationships](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-related-words/). It's designed for writers, poets, language enthusiasts, and anyone who needs to explore the nuances of the English and Spanish languages.

## üöÄ Features

Polyhymnia puts the power of words at your fingertips with four primary
search modes:

* **Meaning**: Discover [words with similar meanings](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-meaning/) using the `--means-like` flag. Perfect for finding that elusive synonym!
* **Sound**: Want [words that sound alike](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-sound/)? Use the `--sounds-like` flag and find perfect rhymes or assonance matches.
* **Spelling**: Search for [words that match a specific pattern](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-words-by-spelling/) with the `--spelled-like` flag, even using wildcards!
* **Related Words**: Explore [synonyms, antonyms, homophones, and more](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-related-words/) using the `--related-word` flag with custom relationship codes.

## üéØ Use Cases

applications!](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/#-use-cases)

1. **Creative Writing & Poetry**: Perfect for finding synonyms, rhymes, or words that fit your poem‚Äôs rhythm or themes.
2. **Songwriting**: Quickly grab rhymes or similar-sounding words to smooth out your lyrics.
3. **Solving Word Puzzles**: Find words that match specific clues based on patterns, meanings, or letter combinations.
4. **Marketing & Branding**: Generate catchy names, taglines, or slogans by searching for words that match a sound or idea.

### Find Related Words

#### The `--related-word` flag

To find words based on specific relationships like synonyms, antonyms, or
homophones, you can use the `--related-word` flag and one of the related
word search codes.

#### Related Word Search Codes

The related word search codes allow you to specify the type of
relationship you're interested in.

| Code  | Description                              | Example            |

| `ant` | Antonyms                                 | late ‚Üí early       |  
| `hom` | Homophones                               | course ‚Üí coarse    |  
| `trg` | Trigger words (commonly associated)      | cow ‚Üí milk         |  
| `jjb` | Adjectives used to modify the given noun | beach ‚Üí sandy      |  
| `jja` | Nouns modified by the given adjective    | gradual ‚Üí increase |  
| `spc` | Hypernyms ("kind of")                    | gondola ‚Üí boat     |  
| `par` | Meronyms ("part of")                     | trunk ‚Üí tree       |

code](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/usage/find-related-words/#related-word-search-codes) **`ant`**. We limit the number of returned words to 3 using the **`--max`**
[flag](https://polyhymnia.daspyro.de/docs/flags/#optional-flags).

#### Optional Flags

| Flag              | Description                                                       |

| `--version`       | Show version information                                          |

#### Metadata Flags

Use these flags to include specific types of metadata in your query results:

| Flag            | Description                         |  
| --------------- | :---------------------------------- |  
| `-d`, `--def`   | Include definitions in results.     |  
| `-f`, `--freq`  | Include word frequency in results.  |

| `-y`, `--syl`   | Include syllable count in results.  |  

### Metadata Options

The `--metadata` flag allows you to request additional information about

request common metadata:

| Letter | Meaning        |  
| :----: | -------------- |  
|   d    | Definitions    |  
|   f    | Word frequency |  
|   p    | Parts of speech|  
|   r    | Pronunciation  |  
|   s    | Syllables      |  

You can combine metadata types to return multiple pieces of information.
For example, `--metadata df` is equivalent to using `--def --freq`.

### Related Word

Polyhymnia's "Related Word" feature offers a deeper dive into lexical
relationships, allowing you to discover words that are connected through
various semantic, phonetic, and usage-based associations. This feature is
especially useful for anyone looking to explore how words are related
beyond mere definitions‚Äîwhether you're hunting for synonyms, antonyms, or
words commonly paired together. By leveraging advanced search codes, you
can fine-tune your queries to surface words with specific kinds of
relationships, all powered by rich data sources like WordNet and Google
Books Ngrams.

Explore the various relationship types below to uncover new word
connections that can inspire creativity, solve puzzles, or enrich your
linguistic research.

| code | Description | Example |
|:---:|-----|-----|
| jja | Popular nouns modified by the given adjective, per Google Books Ngrams | gradual ‚Üí increase |
| jjb | Popular adjectives used to modify the given noun, per Google Books Ngrams | beach ‚Üí sandy |
| syn | Synonyms (words contained within the same WordNet synset) | ocean ‚Üí sea |

| gen | "More general than" (direct hyponyms, per WordNet) | boat ‚Üí gondola |
| com | "Comprises" (direct holonyms, per WordNet) | car ‚Üí accelerator |
| par | "Part of" (direct meronyms, per WordNet) | trunk ‚Üí tree |
| bga | Frequent followers (w‚Ä≤ such that P(w‚Ä≤|w) ‚â• 0.001, per Google Books Ngrams) | wreak ‚Üí havoc |
| bgb | Frequent predecessors (w‚Ä≤ such that P(w|w‚Ä≤) ‚â• 0.001, per Google Books Ngrams) | havoc ‚Üí wreak |
| hom | Homophones (sound-alike words) | course ‚Üí coarse |
| cns | Consonant match | sample ‚Üí simple |

### Vocabulary

The `--vocabulary` flag specifies which vocabulary to use.

* If no vocabulary is specified, a 550,000-term vocabulary of English words and multiword expressions is used.
* `es`  - a 500,000-term vocabulary of words from Spanish-language books.
* `enwiki` - approximately 6 million-term vocabulary of article titles from the English-language Wikipedia, updated monthly.

## Output

Polyhymnia provides the following results:

* **Word**: The vocabulary word.
