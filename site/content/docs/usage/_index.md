Polyhymnia is a versatile tool designed to help you find words based on their meaning, sound, spelling, and moreâ€”all from the command line. This guide will walk you through the basic usage of Polyhymnia and its various options.

```bash
./polyhymnia [options] [action] SearchTerm
```

Polyhymnia requires at least one [action flag](/docs/flags-and-options/#required-flags) to perform a search.

* `--means-like` - [Find Words by Meaning](find-words-by-meaning)
* `--related-word` - [Find Related Words](find-related-words)
* `--sounds-like` - [Find Words by Sound](find-words-by-sound)
* `--spelled-like` - [Find Words by Spelling](find-words-by-spelling)

There are also [numerous other flags](/docs/flags-and-options/) that can be used to customize your search and to control the results that Polyhymnia returns.
